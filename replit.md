# MEGA TIC TAC TOE Game

## Overview

This is a comprehensive implementation of MEGA TIC TAC TOE featuring multiple versions: a Python console version, a modern web interface, and now a **Phaser.js game engine** version packaged with **Apache Cordova for iOS/Android deployment**. The game features 9 interconnected grids (81 squares total) where players must strategically place their marks. The Phaser.js version provides hardware-accelerated graphics, mobile-optimized touch controls, and native app deployment capabilities while maintaining all the complex game mechanics of the original.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The current active version uses the **Phaser.js Game Engine** with a **Scene-based architecture**:

**Architecture Pattern**: Game Engine Scene-based Design
- **Rationale**: Phaser.js provides professional game development patterns with hardware acceleration, mobile optimization, and robust input handling
- **Pros**: Hardware-accelerated graphics, mobile-first design, professional game development workflow, native app deployment
- **Cons**: Larger bundle size (~1.15MB), more complex setup than vanilla JavaScript

**Technology Stack**: 
- **Game Engine**: Phaser.js 3.90.0 (WebGL/Canvas rendering)
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5 with development server and hot reloading
- **Mobile Deployment**: Apache Cordova for iOS/Android packaging
- **Development**: ES6+ JavaScript with modern development workflow

**Legacy Architectures** (Archived):
- **Python Console**: Simple class-based design for terminal gameplay
- **Vanilla Web**: DOM-based implementation with responsive design

## Key Components

## Project Structure

### Phaser.js Game Engine Version (Active)
- `src/main.js`: Complete Phaser.js game implementation with all MEGA TIC TAC TOE mechanics
- `src/index.html`: Mobile-optimized HTML template with Cordova support
- `src/assets/`: Game assets directory (currently empty, ready for icons/sounds)
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack build configuration for development and production
- `cordova-app/config.xml`: Cordova configuration for iOS/Android deployment
- `CORDOVA_DEPLOYMENT.md`: Complete mobile deployment guide
- `dist/`: Built production files (auto-generated)

### Legacy Versions (Archived)
- `legacy-versions/`: Contains previous implementations for reference
  - `main.py`: Original Python console version
  - `index.html.backup`: Original web HTML interface
  - `style.css.backup`: Original web CSS styling
  - `script.js.backup`: Original vanilla JavaScript implementation
  - `server.py.backup`: Simple Python HTTP server

### MegaTicTacToe Class (Python)
The main game class that encapsulates all mega tic tac toe functionality:

**Game State Management**:
- `grids`: List of 9 grids, each containing 9 positions (81 total squares)
- `grid_winners`: Tracks which grids have been won and by whom
- `current_player`: Tracks whose turn it is ('X' or 'O')
- `game_over`: Boolean flag for game completion
- `winner`: Stores the winning player or None
- `active_grid`: Which grid the next player must play in (None if any grid allowed)
- `first_move`: Boolean flag for first move (player can choose any grid)

**Display Methods**:
- `display_board()`: Renders all 9 grids in a 3x3 layout with clear visual separation
- `_get_grid_display()`: Helper method to render individual grid lines
- `display_instructions()`: Shows mega tic tac toe rules and input format

**Game Logic Methods**:
- `check_grid_winner()`: Checks if a specific grid has been won
- `check_winner()`: Checks if the overall mega game has been won
- `is_valid_move()`: Validates moves considering grid restrictions
- `make_move()`: Places marks and updates game state including active grid logic

**Design Decisions**:
- Uses nested lists for 9 grids (2D structure for complex game state)
- Position numbering (1-9) for both grid selection and position within grid
- Active grid system enforces the core mega tic tac toe rule
- Won grids display winner symbol instead of individual positions
- Comprehensive visual layout showing all 81 squares simultaneously

## Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**: Creates 9 empty grids, sets X as starting player, enables first move flexibility
2. **Display Phase**: Shows all 9 grids with position numbers, indicates active grid restrictions
3. **Input Phase**: 
   - First move: Player chooses grid (1-9) then position (1-9)
   - Subsequent moves: Player restricted to specific grid, chooses position (1-9)
4. **Validation Phase**: Checks grid availability, position validity, and active grid restrictions
5. **Update Phase**: Places player's mark, checks for grid wins, determines next active grid
6. **Win Check Phase**: Evaluates individual grid wins and overall mega game victory
7. **Active Grid Logic**: Next player must play in grid matching position number of previous move
8. **Loop**: Returns to display phase unless mega game is won or drawn

## External Dependencies

**Standard Library Only**: The application uses only Python's built-in functionality
- **Rationale**: Keeps the game lightweight and eliminates dependency management
- **Pros**: No installation requirements, works on any Python environment
- **Cons**: Limited to basic console output formatting

## Deployment Strategy

**Local Execution**: Designed to run directly from the command line
- **Target Environment**: Any system with Python 3 installed
- **Execution**: `python3 main.py`
- **No Build Process**: Direct script execution

**Note**: The current code appears to be incomplete, showing only the class definition and initialization methods. The game loop, input handling, win condition checking, and main execution logic would need to be implemented to create a fully functional game.

## Potential Extensions

The current architecture could be extended to include:
- Game loop implementation
- Input validation and error handling
- Win condition detection algorithms
- Score tracking across multiple games
- AI opponent for single-player mode
- Web interface using a framework like Flask
- Multiplayer networking capabilities
